            <h1 class="text-purple">Research/Analysis</h1>
            <p> 
                A survey was conducted by posting a Google form to various university Discord servers. From it, the following data was obtained.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">Public Transit Confidence</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/survey-confidence.png" class="responsive-image" alt="transit confidence data">
            <p>
                Overall, most users seem quite confident in their current ability to use public transit to get where they need to go. Only a very small portion of those were somewhat unconfident.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">Trust in AI Assistance in Public Transit Navigation</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/survey-ai-help.png" class="responsive-image" alt="trust in AI for navigation">
            <p>
                As for whether individuals would trust the use of an artificial intelligence to aid in public transit route planning, the result was nearly unanimous with most people remaining somewhat skeptical in its use.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">Confidence in AI Choices</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/survey-ai-confidence-graph.png" class="responsive-image" alt="confidence in AI choices">
            <p>
            Individuals were then asked to list what they would need in order to feel confident in the output of a given model. The consensus is that nobody would trust an artificial intelligence outright without explanation, but rather build confidence through its use of explanations, comparing multiple options, and citing official sources where necessary.            
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">AI Concerns</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/survey-ai-concerns.png" class="responsive-image" alt="concerns with AI">
            <p>
                Users were then asked to voice their concerns with the usage of artificial intelligence. The top result with 90% of people selecting it was the potential for the model to give wrong advice.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">Difficulties</h4>
            <p>
                Additionally, users were prompted to voice their most significant difficulties in planning trips and buying fares. The most prevalent were the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issues of traffic condition monitoring.</li>
                <li>Delays in the buses/m√©tros themselves.</li>
                <li>Prices.</li>
                <li>Long wait times.</li>
                <li>Having to use multiple apps to check routes and information regarding transit.</li>
            </ul>
