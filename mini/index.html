            <h1 class="text-purple">Understanding the Problem //TODO</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence was largely seen as a gimmick when it was first introduced to the public, creating videos and images that had no sense of the real world. Eventually, AI surpassed this gimmick stage and has become an actual tool that people may use. Some use it to draw images, create fake videos, or to answer their questions, all with data gathered from the internet. Distrust in AI, however, comes from users worrying how the information is gathered, erroneous answers, and how they actually created that answer with the information online. AI sometimes cannot differentiate facts from misinformation on the internet and this can lead to those that over-rely on AI to make more mistakes in day to day life. On the other hand, underreliance in AI will lead to more load being put onto the human side, possibly leading to human error, or just taking an increased amount of time that isn’t necessary when using AI as a tool.
	To bridge this gap between human and AI, there needs to be more transparency on the AI side to show how they got their answers, whether by showing counter examples, sources for their information, or making a summary of what they had found after giving all their info. Chat GPT does this quite well. With a large and diverse number of people using AI, it needs to be able to adapt to all sorts of people and their needs; Some people have different levels of literacy or are less technical than other users.

            <!--Research/Analysis-->

            <h1 class="text-purple">Research/Analysis</h1>
            <p> 
                A survey was conducted by posting a Google form to various university Discord servers. From it, the following data was obtained.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">Public Transit Confidence</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/survey-confidence.png" class="responsive-image" alt="transit confidence data">
            <p>
                Overall, most users seem quite confident in their current ability to use public transit to get where they need to go. Only a very small portion of those were somewhat unconfident.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">Trust in AI Assistance in Public Transit Navigation</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/survey-ai-help.png" class="responsive-image" alt="trust in AI for navigation">
            <p>
                As for whether individuals would trust the use of an artificial intelligence to aid in public transit route planning, the result was nearly unanimous with most people remaining somewhat skeptical in its use.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">Confidence in AI Choices</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/survey-ai-confidence-graph.png" class="responsive-image" alt="confidence in AI choices">
            <p>
            Individuals were then asked to list what they would need in order to feel confident in the output of a given model. The consensus is that nobody would trust an artificial intelligence outright without explanation, but rather build confidence through its use of explanations, comparing multiple options, and citing official sources where necessary.            
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">AI Concerns</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/survey-ai-concerns.png" class="responsive-image" alt="concerns with AI">
            <p>
                Users were then asked to voice their concerns with the usage of artificial intelligence. The top result with 90% of people selecting it was the potential for the model to give wrong advice.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-purple">Difficulties</h4>
            <p>
                Additionally, users were prompted to voice their most significant difficulties in planning trips and buying fares. The most prevalent were the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issues of traffic condition monitoring.</li>
                <li>Delays in the buses/métros themselves.</li>
                <li>Prices.</li>
                <li>Long wait times.</li>
                <li>Having to use multiple apps to check routes and information regarding transit.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--User Goals-->
            <h1 class="text-purple">User Goals //TODO</h1>
            <p>	A user would use this application to figure out the most efficient way to travel in and around Montreal via public transit. This could mean showing how to get from one location to another at a specified arrival time and which modes of public transport should be taken. The user would also want to have the ability to purchase tickets for the STM, no matter which kind of transport they are taking (Bus, Train, Rem, Metro). If users have any questions or specific conditions, they should be able to ask an in-built AI to solve their transport issues/needs.
	Users should be able to trust this app because the data of pricing, tickets, scheduling will all come from official resources like the STM website that shows all schedules for every train, Bus line, metro, and rem, while also warning of delays and cancellations in real time. </p>

            <h1 class="text-purple">Style Guide</h1>
            <p>The style for this app will be a very clean and minimalistic style with very easy to read buttons and not too many colors. The main color scheme will be a plain white with a deep purple/lilac sort of color for accents and the font will be something very easy to read such as “Arial”. A dark mode will also be available to users in the settings which reverses the colors to a darker grey background with paler purple colors.</p>
